Simple Interest Calculator
This is a simple shell script that calculates simple interest based on the principal amount, rate, and time. It is a part of my Git and GitHub practice project.

Prerequisites
A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows)

A shell environment (bash is recommended)

Usage
To run the script, open your terminal and execute it with three command-line arguments:

./simple-interest.sh <principal> <rate> <time>

Arguments:

<principal>: The initial principal amount (e.g., 1000).

<rate>: The annual interest rate (e.g., 5).

<time>: The time in years (e.g., 2).

Example:
To calculate the simple interest for a principal of 1000, a rate of 5%, and a time of 2 years, run the following command:

./simple-interest.sh 1000 5 2

The script will then output the calculated simple interest.
